## Features

- **Highly adaptive** - Adapts both position and scale to the vehicle (works great with planes too! even Bombushka)
- **Configurable** - Players can adjust the hologram to their liking with a GUI
- **Smooth** - Elegant and fluent design
- **Stable** - It just works
- Adjusts brightness according to day/night and in tunnels

## Known issues

- The hologram is slightly blurry when the sky or sea is behind it. (Probbably something to do with the additive alpha shader)

## TODO

- Per-vehicle-model presets
- Externalize GUI into it's own library
